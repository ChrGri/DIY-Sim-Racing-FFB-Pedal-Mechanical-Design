> [!NOTE]
> The proposed PCB is easy to source, but requires manual soldering. The awesome user [gilphilbert](https://github.com/gilphilbert) designed a PCB assembly of the control board which can be found [here](https://github.com/gilphilbert/DIY-Sim-Racing-FFB-Pedal-PCBs) and features the same features as the V6 PCB. It's currently beeing tested. The current status is published on the discord channel.
