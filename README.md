# Motivation
Originally, I built my DIY FFB pedal from metal parts. After using it some time, I got curious whether I can come up with a mechanical design that can be mostly 3d printed and is still rigid enough to withstand the heavy loads accuring in simracing. Furthermore, I wanted to reduce the weight of the components, hopefully seeing a positive impact in the pedal response time. This repo documents the journey of doing that.

# Problem
Usually metal is much stronger than plastic and FDM 3d printed parts are weaker than injection molded counterparts. 

# Solution
Create a mechanical design, which takes into account the weaknesses of using FDM 3d printed pedal parts and make them strong at weak spots.

Here is a description of the design choices:

To minimize torsional force on the vertical pedal arms arising through pedal activation, the upper loadcell joint is placed at similar height as the pedal face plate centrum. A deeper analysis of the pedal kinematics can be found [here](https://github.com/ChrGri/DIY-Sim-Racing-FFB-Pedal/wiki/Pedal-kinematic).

Since the upper loadcell joint is located rather high, a SFU1610 spindle with 10mm pitch was selected to allow fast pedal movement. Lower pitch spindle could provide more torque and thus axial force but at the cost of reduced movement speed. Also, the SFU1610 spindle typically emmits less noise and feel smother than 1605 spindles.

The linked linear guide was selected, since it has 30mm M4 bold pattern, which works perfectly fine with the SK12 blocks (32mm spacing, 6mm holes). 100mm stroke length is more than needed. 75mm or even 50mm might be sufficient for some users. Alternatively [these](https://jlcmc.com/product/s/B16/BQD-JKK60/steel-linear-module-kk60-series#selection-tab) linear guides are really nice too and even can be ordered with covers, but are more expensive and use 30mm M5 bold pattern which cannot be used out of the box with the SK12 blocks.

The loadcell joints are from off-the-shelf SK12 shaft supports. They are easy to source, reasonably cheap and therefore a good buyout option. Since they are made from matel, they are likely stronger than your bones.

The beefy loadcell was choosen, as it has a M12 thread, which allows easy connection with the M12 ball joint. [These](https://a.aliexpress.com/_Ez2kYuf) loadcells are nice too, but would require adapters or redesign of the loadcell arm.


The pedal arms have a certain width to it, to reduce flex, when pedal force is applied off-centre.


As a base-plate a 2080 aluminium extrusion was chooses as it allows easy screw on of attachments as well as easy and flexible attachment to the simrig.


As a FDM material I choosed [PETG-CF](https://amzn.eu/d/00g90wIk), since the carbon fibre particales make the parts supper stiff and the PETG gives good layer bonding while having a better heat resistance than PLA.

## Electronics


### Control PCB
The embedded code of this DIY FFB pedal runs on an ESP32 microcontroller. The PCB design was developed to prove the concept. It holds the ESP32, the ADC, a level shifter, and connectors. Currently, version 3 of this PCB design is used which introduced sensorless homing of the servo. The PCB design and pinout diagram can be found [here](Wiring/Esp32_V3). When a Simucube wheelbase is used, the D15 accessory port can be used for input. For details see [here](Wiring/PCB_analog_output)

Here is an image of the plain PCB:
![](Wiring/Esp32_V3/PCB_empty.jpeg)

Here is an image of the assembled PCB:
![](Wiring/Esp32_V3/PCB_assembled.jpg)

To order the PCB, follow the [instructions](README.md#order-pcb).


HINT:
The proposed PCB is easy to source, but requires manual soldering. The awesome user [gilphilbert](https://github.com/gilphilbert) designed a PCB assembly of the control board which can be found [here](https://github.com/gilphilbert/DIY-Sim-Racing-FFB-Pedal-PCBs). It's currently beeing tested. The current status is published on the discord channel.


### Optional but recommended: Power PCB


Depending on the load direction, the servo will act as a generator. It will produce an additional (reverse) current flow from the servo to the PSU which could trigger the over-voltage protection of the PSU and the servo. The iSV57 has a "bleeding/braking resistor" method to dissipate the current flow as heat and thus reduce voltage spikes causing overvoltage protection trigger. The method will be activated when a predefined bus voltage is exceeded (currently 40V). A plot of the voltage fluctuations can be found below:
<img src="Wiring/PowerPcb/V2/voltageFluctuations.png" height="200">

The trigger voltage was varied in the test (blue: 62V; red: 42V; green: 40V). The horizontal axis shows the time, the vertical axis shows the bus voltage. The pedal was activated a few times, resultig in voltage spikes due to EMF. It can be seen, that the height of the voltage spikes correlate with the trigger voltage. Since the trigger voltage is set to 40V, it is strongly recommended to use a PSU with less than 40V output, otherwise the method will be always active, resulting in an overheating servo. 

Although the iSV57s internal braking resistor method is reliably and mostly sufficient, a power PCB was developed to prevent reverse current flow to the PSU and thus prevent triggering the over-voltage protection of the PSU, by adding a Schottky diode to the power line. To prevent the trigger of the over/under-voltage protection of the servo, a small capacitor was added in the power-line. 


To hold the components in a small package, a [power PCB](Wiring/PowerPcb/V3) was developed, which also featured a port to hold XT30 connectors. 

Photos of the assembled PCB are depicted below: <br>

Warning: The input voltage must not exceed 39V. Recommended voltage is anything between 32V and 37V. 
When the supplied Voltage exceeda 39V, the servo coils might be energized all the time, resulting in excessive heat.

# Tips
To reduce any play in the system, I wrapped some layers of [teflon wrap](https://amzn.eu/d/0cYW6pJp) around the threaded rods and pushed the 608zz bearings and ball rods over it.






# Analysis results
To test the mechanical design, following test were conducted:

## Strength test
To be done! 

Perhaps FEM analysis

## Control loop test
To be done!

Compared to the stainless steel pedal plate, the pedal feels more responsive. Need to verify that by e.g. plotting the closed loop step response here.

Todo:  <br>
1) Weight the parts/pedals.
2) Draw dimensions
3) Capture step respose

# Options

Instead of the 608zz bearing, one can also buy two KP08 bearing blocks and take the bearings from there. The benefir is, that they have a screw flange to remove any play between bearing and axis. An example assembly is depicted below:

# Issues

## Issue 1: servo slips away
It was observed, that the servo slipped away under braking, see [video](https://www.youtube.com/live/HW_phDLIBcU?si=4mNCj0IyTrodPuNm&t=2854).

A different [PSU](https://amzn.eu/d/3srstaF) was used as the one linked in the BOM. It is assumed that due to heavy braking the PSU wasn't able to deliver the necessary power output and the servo went into undervoltage protection, this slipping away. 
Its currently beeing tested, whether that is issue is solved by switching the the PSU from the BOM and what software chnages can mitigate the symptoms in the future.

Updates on this issue will be posted here and almost daily on [youtube](https://youtube.com/@cuttingcorny?si=7AVNgqsLwYK21lRO).

A big thank you to Cuttingcorny for reporting the issue and helping to track the issue down.


# Order PCB
