# DIY-Sim-Racing-FFB-Pedal-Mechanical-Design
If you're used to standard spring or damper-based pedals with rumble motors attached, a force-feedback pedal is the next step. It uses a high power servo attached to a linear rail to control the motion of the pedal. This allows you to change how the pedal feels with a few changes on your PC, whether that's braking pressure, response or travel or the thottle weight or stiffness. You can even use profiles to build different "feels" for different cars, switching profiles between cars to give each vehicle a different driving experience. Additionally, since the pedal movement is controlled, the feedback it can produce is totally different - imaging feeling ABS feedback moving the pedal, the kick of the gear change through the throttle or feedback from road bumps through the pedals. It's an experience like no other! If that sounds like something you want to build for yourself, then read on! This project documents people who want to design and/or build their own force-feedback pedal.

# Project repositories
This project has been divided into multiple repositories, each with differt purposes. The mechanical design repository provides the information you need to build the mechanics of ChrGri's pedal. It's not the only design, but it's strong and reliable. There are more options on the Wiki, and you can find even more designs on the Discord server. The Software repo (this repo) discusses how to select, order and connect the electronics, flash the firmware and get the pedal up and running. The final repo, contains designs for the recommended circuit boards that control the pedal.

# Motivation
Originally, I built my DIY FFB pedal from metal parts. After using it some time, I got curious whether I can come up with a mechanical design that can be mostly 3d printed and is still rigid enough to withstand the heavy loads accuring in simracing. Furthermore, I wanted to reduce the weight of the components, hopefully seeing a positive impact in the pedal response time. This repo documents the journey of doing that.

The 3D printed design is in use since 07/2024 and doesn't show any signs of wear on my side. 

# Problem
Usually metal is much stronger than plastic and FDM 3d printed parts are weaker than injection molded counterparts. 

# Solution
Create a mechanical design, which takes into account the weaknesses of using FDM 3d printed pedal parts and make them strong at weak spots.

Here is a description of the design choices:

To minimize torsional force on the vertical pedal arms arising through pedal activation, the upper loadcell joint is placed at similar height as the pedal face plate centrum. A deeper analysis of the pedal kinematics can be found [here](https://github.com/ChrGri/DIY-Sim-Racing-FFB-Pedal/wiki/Pedal-kinematic).

Since the upper loadcell joint is located rather high, a SFU1610 spindle with 10mm pitch was selected to allow fast pedal movement. Lower pitch spindle could provide more torque and thus axial force but at the cost of reduced movement speed. Also, the SFU1610 spindle typically emmits less noise and feel smother than 1605 spindles.

The linked linear guide was selected, since it has 30mm M4 bold pattern, which works perfectly fine with the SK12 blocks (32mm spacing, 6mm holes). 100mm stroke length is more than needed. 75mm or even 50mm might be sufficient for some users. Alternatively [these](https://jlcmc.com/product/s/B16/BQD-JKK60/steel-linear-module-kk60-series#selection-tab) linear guides are really nice too and even can be ordered with covers, but are more expensive and use 30mm M5 bold pattern which cannot be used out of the box with the SK12 blocks.

The loadcell joints are from off-the-shelf SK12 shaft supports. They are easy to source, reasonably cheap and therefore a good buyout option. Since they are made from matel, they are likely stronger than your bones.

The beefy loadcell was choosen, as it has a M12 thread, which allows easy connection with the M12 ball joint. [These](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DFQ8bjx) loadcells are nice too, but would require adapters or redesign of the loadcell arm.


The pedal arms have a certain width to it, to reduce flex, when pedal force is applied off-centre.


As a base-plate a 2080 aluminium extrusion was chooses as it allows easy screw on of attachments as well as easy and flexible attachment to the simrig.


As a FDM material I choosed [PETG-CF](https://amzn.eu/d/00g90wIk), since the carbon fibre particales make the parts supper stiff and the PETG gives good layer bonding while having a better heat resistance than PLA.

## Electronics


### Control PCB
The embedded code of this DIY FFB pedal runs on an ESP32 S3 microcontroller. The PCB design was developed to prove the concept. It holds the ESP32, the ADC, a RS232 transceiver, brake resistor circuit and connectors. Currently, version 5 of this PCB design is used.

Here are images of the plain PCB:
![](Wiring/PcbV5/PCB_front.jpg)
![](Wiring/PcbV5/PCB_back.jpg)

Here is an image of the assembled PCB:
![](Wiring/PcbV5/PCB_assembled.jpg)

The biggest changes over the previous board generations are listed below.

**Waveshare ESP32 S3:**<br>
The V3 PCB was designed to hold a regular ESP32 dev board. The V4 PCB was designed to hold a ESP32 S3 dev board, which can output native USB HID reports. The S3 required to use two USB cables for stable serial and USB HID output, [see](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/issues/10307#issuecomment-2614795934).

Since using two USB cables isn't nice, the switchover to the waveshare ESP32 S3 was taken, since it features a integrated USB hub.

**RS232 communication:** <br>
In previous board iterations, a simple level shifter was used to transform the RS232 voltage to the TTL voltrage levels of the ESP. This selection requires to follow a specific boot order sequence (first servo, second ESP) to not trigger servo alarms. It was later found, that using a proper RS232 tranceiver is the better choice. Changing to the tranceiver removed the servo alarms. No specific boot sequence is necessary. 

The interested reader can find additional information about the iSV RS232 communication [here](https://github.com/ChrGri/DIY-Sim-Racing-FFB-Pedal/wiki/iSV57-servo-communication).

**Brake resisor design:**<br>
Depending on the load direction, the servo will act as a generator. It will produce an additional (reverse) current flow from the servo to the PSU, which could trigger the over-voltage protection of the PSU and the servo. To prevent this, a two stage brake resistor design was developed
1) The iSV57 has a "bleeding/braking resistor" method to dissipate the current flow as heat and thus reduce voltage spikes causing overvoltage protection trigger. The method will be activated when a predefined bus voltage is exceeded (currently 40V). A plot of the voltage fluctuations can be found below:<br>
<img src="Wiring/PowerPcb/V2/voltageFluctuations.png" height="200">
2) Especially at long pedal strokes, the dissipation capacity of the iSV's "bleeding/braking resistor" can be exceeded. To prevent overvoltage triggers, an additional external brake resistor was introduced. The external brake resistor is automatically triggered by the ESP, whenever the voltage of the bus exceeds a certain threshold, thus dissipating additional electrical energy. The brake resistor circuit is closed with the help of a FR120N mosfet. The mosfet activation is indicated by a red led, as depicted below <br>

To order the PCB, follow the [instructions](README.md#order-pcb).

HINT:
The proposed PCB is easy to source, but requires manual soldering. The awesome user [gilphilbert](https://github.com/gilphilbert) designed a PCB assembly of the control board which can be found [here](https://github.com/gilphilbert/DIY-Sim-Racing-FFB-Pedal-PCBs). It's currently beeing tested. The current status is published on the discord channel.



### Wiring
The wiring is depicted in the image below <br>

## Alterations
Here are some nice upgrades.

### 608zz to KP08 bearing

Instead of the 608zz bearing, one can also buy two [KP08 bearing blocks](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_Dk7Wokt)
and take the bearings from there. The benefit is, that they have a screw flange to remove any play between bearing and axis. An example assembly is depicted below:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c72b740b-9519-4c30-9dbc-9c240b687ce9).


### JKK rail

I'm currently using a [JKK60-10-P-150-A1-F4-C-M](https://jlcmc.com/product/s/B16/BQD-JKK60/steel-linear-module-kk60-series#selection-tab) on my trottle. It's noticeably quieter than the Aliexpress guide. However, it was almost 5 times as expensive inlcuding shipping and taxes. To hold the JKK rail, a 3d printable adapter is used, which can be found [here](CAD/JKK_rail_chris/Jkk_to_2080_adapter v1.stl). 

### DYLY-107 loadcell
Instead of the beefy loacell, smaller ones can be found [here](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DFQ8bjx). No immediate performance upgrade was observed. 

The thread of the DYLY-107 loadcell is M8. The beefy loadcell has a M12 thread. 

Needed changes:<br>
- Instead of using a SK12, a SK8 block fits well, e.g. [link](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_okuBOQ9)
- balljoints: switch to M8 type balljoints, e.g. [link](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_opZom53)
- The remaining M12 rods have to be exchanged by M8 versions.

To reduce any play in the system, I wrapped some layers of [teflon wrap](https://amzn.eu/d/0cYW6pJp) around the threaded rods and pushed the 608zz bearings and ball rods over it.






# Analysis results
To test the mechanical design, following test were conducted:

## Strength test
To be done! 

Perhaps FEM analysis

## Control loop test
To be done!

Compared to the stainless steel pedal plate, the pedal feels more responsive. Need to verify that by e.g. plotting the closed loop step response here.

Todo:  <br>
1) Weight the parts/pedals.
2) Draw dimensions
3) Capture step respose
