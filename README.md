# DIY-Sim-Racing-FFB-Pedal-Mechanical-Design


# Motivation
Originally, I built my DIY FFB pedal from metal parts. After using it some time, I wanted to know, whether I can come up with a mechanical design that can be mostly 3d printed and is still rigid enough to withstand the heavy loads accuring in simracing. Furthermore, I wanted to reduce the weight of the components, hopefully seeing a positive impact in the pedal response time. This repo documents the journey of doing that 

# Problem
Usually metal is much stronger than plastic and FDM 3d printed parts are weaker than injection molded counterparts. 

# Solution
Create a mechanical design, which takes into account the weaknesses of using FDM 3d printed pedal parts. 

Here is a description of the design choices:

To minimize torsional force on the vertical pedal arms arising through pedal activation, the upper loadcell joint is placed at similar height as the pedal face plate centrum.

Since the upper loadcell joint is located rather high, a SFU1610 spindle with 10mm pitch was selected to allow fast pedal movement. Lower pitch spindle could provide more torque and thus axial force but at the cost of reduced movement speed. Also, the SFU1610 spindle typically emmits less noise and feel smother than 1605 spindles.

The loadcell joints are from off-the-shelf SK12 shaft supports. They are easy to source, reasonably cheap and therefore a good buyout option. Since they are made from matel, they are likely stronger than your bones.



The pedal arms have a certain width to it, to reduce flex, when pedal force is applied off-centre.

As a FDM material, I choosed [PETG-CF](https://amzn.eu/d/00g90wIk), since the carbon fibre particales make the parts supper stiff and the PETG gives good layer bonding while having a better heat resistance than PLA.
