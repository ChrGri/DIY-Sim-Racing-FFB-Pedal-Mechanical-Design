# Loadcell investigations
The acuracy of different loadcell types was checked [here](https://github.com/ChrGri/DIY-Sim-Racing-FFB-Pedal/wiki/Improving-the-loadcell-reading).

In essence, no significant empirical difference between DYLY-107 and YZC-516C loadcells have been observed.

It's recommended to choose a 50kg loadcell rather than higher rated variants, since they lower rated variants offer better noise figures. The 50kg rated loadcell can withstand large enough forces, significantly higher than 50kg, but their linearity might suffer a bit. Linearity isn't a problem at all though.
