# Brake resistor investigations
In previous version only a condensator was used to store the servos EMF. Since V5 PCB, a brake resistor circuit was implemented to dissipate the electrical energy, see the dedicated section [here](BrakeResistor). 

# ADC
Some investigations to improve the loadcell reading accuracy have been done. Results are documented [here](ADC).

# Loadcell
Some investigations regarding different loadcel types have been done. Results are documented [here](Loadcell).
